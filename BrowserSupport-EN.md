# Browser Support and Audio Quality

VSMR supports audio transmission with up to two channels, using the Opus Codec at 500kbps.

### VSMR recommends using Google ChromeðŸ’ª (Safari for iPhone/iPad)

Note! On iPhone/iPad, VSMR cannot be used with browsers other than Safari. Additionally, Safari currently only supports mono audio transmission.

Moreover, VSMR's functionality and bug fixes are only supported on **Google Chrome**. We generally do not support issues that occur on browsers other than Google Chrome.

## Summary of Browser Compatibility Tests

* Calls cannot be made from Firefox (but can be received)
* Audio becomes mono when using Safari (due to SDP differences)
* High-quality communication is possible with Google Chrome on both Win/Mac (Stereo microphones and earphones are required)
* When using Google Chrome, if the other party has a stereo microphone, the audio will be in stereo

* Network delays increase with slower networks, higher ping, or longer network communication paths (inevitable...)
